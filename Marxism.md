# What is Marxism?
## Evergreen Description
Marxism is a political ideology rooted in the writings of Karl MArx - it concentrates on spreading the concentration of wealth away from a central source and is a critique of [[capitalism]] believing that power must always be concentrated only in the hands of those who produce material good, but that as well it should not be concentrated wholly whatsoever.

### Connections to Web3
Oddly, Marx's critiques of capitalism are well suited for a [[Web 3]]  reality because the allowance for individuals to own the production of their own goods. The inconguence is rooted in a belief that no one should indeed own property, however, because ownership is theft from those who would otherwise benefit from an owned good.
