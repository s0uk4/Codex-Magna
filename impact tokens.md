# What are impact tokens?
## Evergreen Description:
Impact tokens are a concept explored by [[IXO]] and Shaun Conway as a element of a verification system that has the function of describing quantifiable success in a system that intends to execute a certain 'goal'. The goal of 'impact' to examine the measured execution of those successes and then minting an NFT that exemplifies this success while summarizing the work that is done.

## Notes
gavin dove deep around regen and ixo
- real world applications
- unconference - gregory and shaun
	- collaboration and funding

Knowledge graphs are the way that things are built - ixo is doing the same thing.
-> graphs are difficult to replicated because they become entrenched and define data structures. The knowledge is the set of libraries - the use of libraries spreads out hte graph.
	- facebook has a library of artifacts for what a profile is, what a feed is, simple data structures and linking them together to be the social graph
- ixo json ld links in a semantic graph - 
	- w3c -berners-lee semantic web needs to be decentalization
	- decentralized identifiers
	- application of link data
- creating the link data graph and the identifier layer
	- identifier layer is fixing the web by fixing the addressed ability of an object in digital space
	- current means is IP and abstracted into URL
	- there's no way to authenticate node
		- level of assumption and lack of trust
- decentralized identifiers provide an URI
	- cryptographically identified element that allows you to apprehend
	- pgp privacy and handing around private keys that will allow you to authenticate - DIDs that can be authenticated
	- if you create an identifier on the blockchain (NFTs, etc) for a claim
- outcome states - representation of the outcome state with the identifier - based on new web standards, associates in verifiable ways to find the service endpoints
	- it advises you of a service and then gives you the control mechanisms of how to get to the service endpoint, then you need to sign with the key because you're the owner of the key that will let you through the door.
- information about the asset that you want to make available
	- associated claims related to the door, a trusted party has made a claim on their end.
	- verification service providers
		- identity verification. You send info, they run verification. 
		- prediction on the claim, and then increasing the verification of the claim
		- loss of credibility, there could be a legasl case against them
	- So how do you make that more trustless / less centralized
		- staking mechanism - Onfido - equifax
		- machine learning predicting the true-ness of the claim and the ability to check the graph for veracity
	- newcomer to the market - it's going to cost me money if you don't offer a good service, you need to put down a deposit - a negligent verification / claim
	- every claim is visible and verifiable at particular moments in time
	- the delta in the state change - the earth state change is the basis for the chain state change
		- sustainable defi
	- publicly available satellite imagery that verify changes
		- making the images available through an Erc-721 token on ipfs - this doesn't nececssarily make this work
		- what if you took the image and stored them in a decentralized image library in order to have access to the library - the opportunity to check the library
		- interchain - z-caps - authorization capabilities
			- sign authorizations, then transfer the message to someone. If they hold the keys, they can do what the key says they can do.
			- delegation of authority to use the imagery
				- zCaps - delegate authorization of access
					- w3c - Mark Miller
					- provocative questions - whether zCap modules implemented in cosmos Go module - would it compete with ECMA object capabilities
				- berners-lee explained to obj cap from deep academic position
					- found an incredibly interested group of engineers who could do this within the new software architecture in w3c capabilities
					- first time people thought it was important, berners-lee cried.
					- javascript-based - mark miller
					- rebuilding web-trust - linked object capabilities
					- Agoric allows them to inject on javascript in particular.
				- can be done off chain, but on chain access provides the means
				- the database needs to implement object capabilities
					- permission o-auth
					- loses dependence on the path if the path is cut because it doesn't require real-time connection to the source of authority
			- rights to access - both can be implemented within the NFT model
				- machine executable rights
				- legal rights
					- implemented by legacy and human systems
			- merchandising rights
		- graph side - shaun conway - high definition - data
			- claims about a subject - creating a high resolution network of associated claims
			- high-fidelity - can be verified
		- collecting data in high definition - the identifier is within the object, then has all the claim attributes that are verifiable
			- semantically defined terms that can be verified
				- schema.org - improving the semantic web
				- semantically defined schema for what things should/can be defined
				- we all agree what a semantic term means - an agreement to use the same semantic definition
			- json ld allows you to check all the semantic associations between the pieces of the graph and descriptions - navigability around all the connections that verify the data
	- ixo is the internet of impact because it is an interconnection that is a stateful, graph that is programmable - if the state changes to this state, then make a payment
		- generic can be used for just about anything
