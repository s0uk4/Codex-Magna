# What does Figment as a company do?

Let's open by considering protocol in the many meanings of the word - under the computer science definition, protocol is a sequence of rules by which a system functions. The same is true in Web 3 - protocols are interpretive systems through which to build markets around financial primitives.

In the context of Figment as a company operating in the Web 3 space, we can define another structure by which 'protocol' can be contextually defined. For our purposes, protocol will constitute the similar terms - a set of rules by which a system can act.

By building out the process of building out a retinue of available staking products, we are also gaining the chance to watch each of these protocols unfold through the development process to become mature technologies. In the act of working with them, we gain insight into what effective protocol launch looks like, and how we fit into the building process.

In the emerging protocol stage, we create and refine the processes by which we are able to establish a neutral view of how a good protocol launch procedure. By taking part in the initial-through-launch process of relationship-building with a protocol, we enable those with whom we have partnerships to grow into mature protocols with strong networks of affiliation and resilience.

In the mainnet stage, a protocol team aims to put itself in a position to continue growing the reach of a protocol - bringing people into development pipelines to grow the utility of the protocols. As a result of this, we increase developer volume on the protocols that we're a part of, and work to raise a protocol's token price as a result.

## Critiques

Most significantly, we do not have experience building out protocols themselves. We can only offer insight into what it means for us to build out our available services with them, not what the actual process of protocol launch. We gain insight into what the staking process can look like and what well-implemented validating solutions look like - but this does not mean we know anything about the launch process from within the protocols themselves.

What, then, is the product that we have to offer about launch? At this point, it would seem to be purely procedural - what stages arrive at what states of the roadmap - and to offer reductions in opportunity cost.
