## Evergreen Description
**There are no leaderless organizations, because anything without a formal organizational structure will eventually find an informal organization structure. This organization might take shape around experience and knowledge, if not seniority, but an emergent organizational structure will always arise. **

### Reasoning:
In distributed organizations, you instead see vectorization of contribution concentration, where a 'manager' is simply a node that concentrates energy in an organizational system and an 'individual contributors' vectorize the energy for use between nodes. 

This way, the hierarchy is not necessarily about who has the most decision-making power, but rather who it is that has the most connections to their surrounding environment - an argument that inevitably puts the best connected 'managers' in the best position to dictate where energy flows can be established. These energy concentrators are the 'elites' of the system, but must not be seen negatively such if properly defined and correctly functioning, because they are important to the flow of energy throughout an organizational system.

## Additional
DAOs are not leaderless because they end up with 'authority' based on the concentration of energy. This is the reason that reputation / contribution-based systems make the most sense.
