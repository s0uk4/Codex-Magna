# what is capitalism?
## Evergreen Description
Capitalism is the movement of a system toward the accrual of resources - but where most have decided that capitalism has been a broad, massive phenomenon, I'd posit that capitalism is a local phenomenon.

It is different depending on where you look and how you interact with it. It is not monolithic, as Marx would have us assume, but rather the product of scaled exchange seeking mutual trust in transaction - nothing more. The definition ebbs, flows, and alters course depending on how it is used - if it is used brutally, it's effects are brutal, extractive, and do not feed back into the systems it takes from. But it is not any one thing, any one system of standardization, [[coherence]], or determinacy.

Capitalism is a took for evaluating over modes of exchange by declarinh mutual forms of value. In order to do this effectively, the coherences can be temporary, subtle, and varied - but they must be to mutual benefit, if not ideal in their practice. There is no one capitalism, there is simply every local set of values and the incentives that fuel their sustenance, but still accrue toward shared value.
