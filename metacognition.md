# What is Metacognition?

Metacognition is the precondition of being about to think about one's own thoughts and describe intent in the thought-objects of other parties, leading to having been a postulated procondition for intelligence. The conditions of intelligence emerging from metacognition arrive through the externalization of information. Inference exists as an assessment of means-end execution as any particular string of processes arrive to their conclusion, and the ability to hold a process of outcomes apart from the process under action is a metacognitive process.
