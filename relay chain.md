# What is a relay chain?
A relay chain is a connective blockchain surface offering that allows a number of other networks to correspond with one another and with a consensus structure in a shared security model that validates transactions between parties on connected parachains. 

In this way - a relay chain is a transaction later for chains that don't want to build their own consensus model. A relay chain offers this functionality as a base-layer, allowing parachains to concentrate on their service offering first.

## Understanding the relay chain service offering

As a result of being able to access the advantages of the relay chain, development teams looking to scale their blockchain offerings need only ro product a chain that can interfact with the relay chai8n - and then the relay chaing takes care of consensus for them.

The great advantage here is that if you are looking to start up a project - you need to you can dispense with the details that surrouind consensus. Consensus is energetically costly (?) and complex. Creating a new consensus model for every parachain offering isn't necessarily scalable, nor does it make sense for growth.
