## Evergreen Description
A process of learning something means that a person must associate it with their prior thoughts and knowledge in order to integrate it into their frameworks of [[knowledge]].

## Notes

Relational learning also depends on the process of elaboration and question-framing - where the act of reading something is with the intent to explore the meanings behind the text and frame them with the questions that a reader entered the text looking to answer.
