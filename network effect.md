# What is a network effect?
## Evergreen description
Network effect is the ability for a particular set of connections to supercede the generation of new connections due largely to the cominance of the primary set. In this way, the 'network effect' of the larger network edges out the utility of smaller networks before they are able to expand in a meaningful way.
