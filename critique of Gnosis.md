## In short:
Deciding whether or not what Gnosis has to offer is interesting is based on recognizing a few contextual reasons that it might not be, namely the difficulty of drumming up a revenue stream in a relatively unused Ethereum clone, 

### Business Development

We have no real guarantee that this is something people will actually stake, and we have no real idea if this is something that anyone has any interest in staking. We also don't know how secure this logic is - much of what we're seeing with this chain is a heavily centralized distribution of tokens being turned into incremental rewards for staking, but there's no guarantee of the value increasing at the rate that might be predicted.

### Design Language

The 'canary chain' is not a panacea for doing real world testing - just because it works in the context of the Polkadot/Kusama canary pair doesn't mean that it will work in the context of any other chain.

The Kusama canary chain makes sense because it's part of the design language of the Polkadot protocol. Argument that Kusama will differentiate into its own chain aren't based on a complete understanding of how the network functions - Polkadot does not exist without Kusama, and Kusama exists for Polkadot. If there is any differentiation, it will come in the form of community, not technology.

Keeping this in mind, Kusama is a canary network for Polkadot by design. Gnosis is being adapted for this purpose. Even with increased block times and shorter rollout schedules, there is no realistic connection between Ethereum and Gnosis. Gnosis is not on the Ethereum roadmap, and indeed doesn't need to be.

### The ossification of the Ethereum main network and the meaning of a rollup

The next point, leading from the previous, is that the Ethereum network is unlikely to change much in its current implementation - the roadmap has been effectively set, and any changes that will happen with the development of the layer one protocol are likely to be incremental - Ethereum will proceed toward the merge, and then the design language will remain as it has been.

Gnosis would be a dramatic deviation from the standard rhetoric of current Ethereum development. It doesn't take implementation of a canary chain test network out of the question, but it does mean it's unlikely. Experimentation of the Layer 1 is not an imperative - the network is already mature enough not to need what Gnosis has to offer.

Far more likely is that rollups will be where all testing is done - this is because rollups offer faster finality all around, so any increase in block time on a layer 1 implementation is unlikely to offer an advantage _unless acts as an environment in which to test rollup design._ This final point is probably the most important, and would be a point toward the utility of working on something like Gnosis.

### Parting shots across the bow

The last question to ask is: if Gnosis offers a good environment within which to test rollup design, why Gnosis? Why not test rollup design in a constellation of shards that live on [[EVM]] chains in Cosmos? Is this the bull case for Sagan?
