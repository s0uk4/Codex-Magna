# What is diversity, equity, and inclusion?
## Evergreen Description
Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI herein) emerges from the premise that systems do not accomodate for the breadth of perspectives to which they both affect and on which they have an effect. DEI initiatives intend to make the systems that they are a part of more inclusive in order to bring in more perspectives, so that the systems are more equitable to the highest diversity of interacting agents who will touch the system. ***Importantly - DEI initiatives in the institutional sense omit the primary utility function of their own initiatives: DEI is not primarily about participation and accomodation, but rather creating robusticity in the adaptation set that a system has at its disposal.***
### DEI initiatives as a patchwork solution to inequitable systems
When considering how DEI initiatives are deployed in modern settings, it is usually in critique to the lack of DEI within the systems that are being examined. Solutioning is usually sought as a mitigation method against the lack of DEI in the systems that are being critiqued, so initiatives are deployed with the intent to fix this problem.

Ironically, systems that attempt to solve for DEI inadequacies within themselves are usually already ossified with reference to the structures within them that don't account for DEI - applying a corrective measure to a broken system will not change how the system was made (per [[system design]]). Therefore truthfully the only way to solve for obvious problems with a system's lack of DEI is to redesign the whole system from first principles, part of which means including DEI as a guiding principle for seeding the system at the outset.

The net effect of doing so is that systems designed from the ground up with DEI a part of their structure will necessarily demonstrate the robusticity present in adaptable systems, because the solution set will already have an advantage in its adaptive qualities.
