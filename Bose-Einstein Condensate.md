# What is Bose-Einstein Condensate
## Evergreen Description
The condensate is a sync state between a large number of atoms in matter of perfect density acting as a single particle of probabilistic phase and amplitude. Touches on the theme of [[incoherence]] among particles in a system - wherein [[coherence]] comes from a perfect synchonization state between particles as can be described by the condensate's probabilistic nature.

## Notes
"The phenomenon of Bose-Einstein condensation is almost unimaginably alien. No one quite knows how to describe what it means. It’s often said that the individual atoms coalesce into a single, giant “superatom.” Others have characterized the new state as a “smeared-out, overlapping stew.” My own preference is for the language used by the Royal Swedish Academy. The analogy to singing in unison is in the right spirit. Like a sine wave or any other wave, the quantum wave associated with a boson (or what we’ve been calling its probability cloud) has both an amplitude and a phase. In a Bose-Einstein condensate, all these waves are locked in step. Their troughs and crests line up; physicists say they are “phase coherent.”
