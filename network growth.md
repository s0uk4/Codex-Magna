# How do networks grow?
## Evergreen Description
the question should at first not be 'how do networks grow' but rather, 'at what point do networks sustain efficiently sustain themselves?'

A network with open-ended growth is parasitic, a network that has reached a degree of sustainability will not negatively take from neighboring networks.

## Notes
### Sync
A core tenet of network growth is recognizing the importance of small world systems in growing/maintaining a network. Strogatz references this in Sync when he mentions that small-world networks (strong convictions, weakly held) with a low degree of randomness and high [[clustering]] are best positioned for [[network resilience]]. 

Therefore networks that establish a number of [[small-world]] connections are able to sustain their network volume more comfortably. Highly-connected individual nodes act as information highways for local clusters, so that the network has strong long-distance connections across shorter [[path length]], leading in turn to [[small-world]] connectivity as information travels across less steps to get to it's destination.

This allows the network to be well-connected across distances and increases resiliency

### Mushrooms
- Contamination precedes coordination, and makes diversity.
- William Geddes examined that the patrilineal connection of Hmong communities allowed their communities to maintain stron familial ties across distances.
