## Notes
###  Traumatic freedom
Freedom comes from boundary conditions - where there is unrest, or there is imbalance. Because war is the navigation of frontiers - disagreements over cetrainty, over allocation, over property, ideological barriers - frontiers form at the edges of these conflicts. This is where true freedom emerges - where most rules are suspended. The traumatic freedom of these liminal spaces is where some seek to return to - a total liberation from conformation to function under a regimented and single-minded desire to support ideals.
