# What is the meaning of conviviality?

## Evergreen Description
We entrust institutions to with our guidance rather than trusting ourselves to learn guidance from our experiences and to learn good morals from these experiences as a collective. 
*A connected society can only orient itself toward the solutions it seeks if it is existing with a recognition of the thresholds to it's growth, the tools it needs in order to sustain itself, and a recognition of the interdependence necessary to sustain a state of conviviality - the ability for members of a society to live in balance with one another.*
### Three core concepts:
- **1. the [[organizational threshold]] and its limits**
	 -  There are consumptive limits to the growth of a system - similar to Geoffrey West's purportion that any public or common good requiring too much maintenance will overtake the benefits that it provides. **The question is posed: "What can an institution offer if not more of itself?", in recognizing that institutions seek to perpetuate themselves.**
- **2. Tools to Work With**
	- Modern industrial society has put us in service to the tools that we use, in continuing to do so, we relegate ourselves to the status of slaves to these machines, rather to the interest of ourselves. Technology was meant to empower us but instead lead us toward being a dependent structure for the institution.
	- #question - is this what a DAO does? Does a DAO cause everyone to take part in it's maintenance while promising small morsels of autonomy over those who take part in it?
- **3. Interdependence**
	-  Working toward a state of conviviality allows us to create a sense of joint [[narrative]] that urges us toward common goals. Institutions put themselves in the position of creating a joint narrative that guide us decisions in service of the larger structure.
