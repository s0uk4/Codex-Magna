## xDai <> Gnosis

### In short:
Gnosis is looking to become a [[canary network]] for Ethereum. It will provide an ideal thinking space with low finality to consider the evolution of the Ethereum post-merge ecosystem. 

Proponents of this design contend that it will make the deployment of EVM projects that much easier to implement and experiment with in an active operation space and lower overall gas cost.

### Notes

looks like the merge is happening, significant, converting STAKE tokens into GNO, effectively a token merger or an acquisition of stake
- turning xDAI into Gnosis - Gnosis will shift it to Ethereum proof of stake, along with a beacon chain where GNO tokens will be able to staked.
- Faster finality, 8 blocks instead of 32 blocks
	generally faster block times.
- Otherwise following the ETH2 roadmap - looking to be the Kusama network equivalent on Gnosis.
- Aragon put focus onto Gnosis chain - will provide the main client for the network - quite close to being production ready.
- hoping to keep block space open, but it's possible that it could slow down, trying to keep gas prices down even though that's likely to change. 1c=100k gas
	- one idea, 'poor man's sharding' - running multiple gnosis chains in parallel.
		- fairly simple to build a trustless bridge between network (*ask about IBC sharding*)
		- Gnosis and Ethereum light client bridge
		- sharding then in the Gnosis network
	- Gnosis would not be doing computational sharding (unlike Kusama)
	- Same applications on every network, then distribute users across networks (similar to gaming networks)
	- Arbitrum running on Gnosis already (rollups are still early)
- Trying not to screw things up off the bat
	- the ecosystem must also be well grown
	- moving important applications onto Gnosis
		- Circles, Dark Forest
		- staking infrastructure and middleware that devs might need
- experimentation?
	- Anyone will be able to build here because they'll be able to build much sooner and in a much more interesting way.
		- Gnosis was maintaining the ethereum main client and working in core dev
			- Things are moving really slowly now, BLS precompile wouldn't be included
				- Not enough people were confident enough in having it function
			- Allowing you to be experimental
			- trying out new curves on rollups, and seeing how they execute
		- Ethereum will always move slowly, Gnosis will let you benchmark success that can be deployed to Ethereum.
		- If there's not real activity on the networks
		- Test networks don't reflect real action
- GNO centralization - not actually that centralized
	- the treasury had most of GNO
	- 1.5mil out of 10mil in circ
	- acquisition will take 300kGNO into circulation
	- 8.5mil will be reserved as staking rewards
	- there is no need for 8.2mil GNO
	- conservative estimate of GNO for the network, and the rest will be burned
	- planning to create certainty around supply
- What does it take for us to stake on Gnosis? How do we get exposure?
	- any sort of staking services that allow GNO token holders to stake
	- exposure to tokens - that can be worked on eventually
	- GnosisDAO allocation? - possibly GNO otc -
	- Developer community
	- The Graph implementation
- Grants for implementation?
	- DAO is mostly going to decide this
	- one org who will invest?
	- proposals could easily be implemented through the DAO
	- EIP process on Gno - then make the proposal public, then make it public and could go through
- What kind of timeline?
	- generally move fast, trying to add clients as fast as possible

2016 - 2021 Gavin wet dream combination
- follow the ethereum roadmap
- beacon chain-y as possible
- we've built some serious ethereum capacity, hoenstly if it's the same thing, we should be able to pitch it
- easy to pitch
	- we want to build out a yield product in advance of the market
	- don't build a business case, build an investment case
- .5B mcp
	- currently 1% of ETHmcp, could be 10% of current Eth value
		- 10x
- going through a DAO?
	- We have gone through Cosmos HUB
	- Yannick got polkadot
	- Roadblocks?
		- get close to formalization off chain first in the form of a Gnosis Improvement Proposal
		- There would be discussion beforehand, asking and seeing what makes sense, we'd be able to work with them to build it out in a way that makes sense
		- We would then see how public discussions would look, then propose
