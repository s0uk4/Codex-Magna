Crowdloan issues - we didn't get to participate
ballot side election rewards
collators on the network
- staking for those who join the set, not NPoS - active in the set, not how Astar does it
- Offering space as an EVM <>WASM structure for secure smart contracts
- permissionless collators on minimum amount of tokens, not election
	- crowd staking - based on smart contracts.
		- dApp staking is in MVP stage
		- the rewards for supporting are localized and scaled based on backing
		- dApp staking 2.0 will choose what kind of rewards will be offered to backers
		- 
	- for figment we can discuss whitelisted collation, joining the initial collator set, then rewards can be used however you want
		- complexity of operation? - permissionless collator
		- no slashing, but they get booted if they aren't live
		- looking to have strict requirements for collation
		- projects who can work on community staking
		- focusing also on Rust developers so that they can be ported to the space
			- onboarding into the Astar env, basically
			- focus on WASM
	- partner node operation - session keys ported over?\
		- solution for collator staking?
		- 10% APY
			- 70%ish
		- mkcp
		- 

Collator rewards are very high because of a limited set, lots of blocks every hour. Dynamic reward pallet should find the balance between both staking operations - 

10x of Shiden earnings overall
