# What is individuality?
## Evergreen Description
Individuality is often cast as though part of some immutable whole, and definable with exactitude - the reality is that individuality is more likely to be a spectrum of associations following essentially three rules: 
- individuality can exist at any biological level
- individuality can be nested (i.e. one individual can exist inside of another individual)
- individuality exists on a continuum, with quantifiable degrees of individuality within an entity

Not so much by contrast, [[Rousseau]] defined individuals in relation to their responsibilities to the social connections of which they are a part - an individual is the degree to which an entity does or does not have associations with the wider system. [[Rousseau]] justifies this by phrasing the formation of the state as the network of connections comprising the body politic, resulting in interdependencies that connect this new [[sovereign]] to its constituent parts.

## Notes:
There exist three types of individualities (along the biological definition):
1. organismal individuality - an entity that is shaped by environmental factors and strongly self-organizing and all action within the system is based entirely on prior states of the entity.
2.  colonial individuality - an entity that is a complex relationship between internal and external factors (networks / colonies / webs)
3.  environmental individuality - the phenomenon of entity falls apart in dissociation from the environmental conditions that allow it.
Through these three definitions, type 3 is likely to have been what 'life' looked like at first conception - a phenomenological event arising entirely from environmental conditions. Seeing individuality on a gradient from Type 3 --> Type 1 allows us to see that there are 'degrees' of individuality.
