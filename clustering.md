# What is clustering?
## Evergreen Description
Clustering is a measure of the connections that individual nodes have within a network. Writ broadly, clustering illustrates the connectivity of individuals to their surrounding networks. 

The removal of nodes that demonstrate this connectivity can damage the resilience of networks by not providing meaningful degrees of freedom or efficiency for information to move throughout systems.
