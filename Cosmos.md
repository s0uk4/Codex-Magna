# What is Cosmos
## Evergreen Description
The Cosmos SDK is an interoperable [[blockchain]] ecosystem facilitating simple connection of blockchains with one another using the Inter Blockchain Communication ([[IBC]]). Cosmos makes this easy and straightforward, additionally providing common ground around which protocols can build their protocols within what is provided by the SDK. 

Most importantly, access to building in the space is 'rent free' - in that those who build within it only need to spin up nodes in order for other protocols to interact with their protocol.

### Critiques of the Cosmos SDK
While the SDK offers a slew of options that allow protocols to interact more easily, the freedom with which they are able to do so comes at the cost of shared security, which must be built ad-hoc and electively within the relationships between protocols, unlike [[Polkadot]], which offers this by virtue of being connected to their relay chain.
