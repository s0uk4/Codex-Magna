# Understanding Canary networks

A canary network is a vital trial environment that allows protocols to both test the stability of major applications in real-world use conditions, allowing developers to execute high-iteration applications stress tested against the conditions that exist in the real world and the incentives that come from embracing a chaotic system with a higher degree of risk.

## What is a Canary Network?

The name 'canary network' comes from the an extension of a 'mining' analogy used throughout blockchain - the extraction of information from a set of executable hash results in verifiably unique and scarce data, much in the same way that real world resources are 'mined' from the earth's surface. The 'canary in the coal-mine' provides a miner with an appreciation for the conditions of safety in a mine; since birds in general are notoriously sensitive to changes in conditions, the death of a 'canary' while down in the mine would be an indication of volatile or dangerous gases in the air during the operation of a mine.

### What does a canary network do in the context of blockchain?

We usually understand an object path from test network to main network, from 'testnet'to 'mainnet'. Test networks use test currency, while main networks operate with fungible tokens that represent immutable value. In the Polkadot/Kusama ecology, the path from testnet to mainnet includes another interstitial layer - the canary network.

The canary network is intended to offer a similar purpose - it allows a set of developers participating in the execution of a network to check for the safety of an active execution environment - though fortunately in this situation they dispense with the cruelty on birts.

By operating a canary network on Kusama before launching to a primary slot on Polkadot, a prospective Polkadot network can test the viability of the network in a real-world setting in order to see if the intended model executes similar to the manner in which it does in a testing environment. So why might someone choose this model rather than stress-testing an industrial scale model outright?

There are two main reasons:
- canary networks create a real economy
- you can never plan for the conditions of the real world

### What's the difference between a canary network and test network?
The essential difference between a test network and a canary network is that a test network never operates with any fungible assets; all assets that operate on a test network have no value - and so tests can only reflect prediction of how transactions will take place on the network. While running a test environment can account for the lion's share of issues that may be experienced on a main network, there is always a degree of interaction that will not be evidenced in testing and for which real-world testing can account.

In order to prevent a steep increase in failures - having an actively labeled and far more volatile proving-ground is an instrumental step in ensuring that a network is ready to deploy with the scaling solutions that Polkadot strives to offer. Kusama provides network operators the opportunity to examine the outcomes of real retail and institutional users in order to examine the results of their intended execution. The assets that are traded on Kusama are fully fungible and the transactions that result from their exchange are a representation of real value for their users, which means that the incentives for transactions and deployment are just as real as the insights their results provide.

The question here is whether or not this approach has any value - why might someone decide to execute with real world transactions in the Kusama ecology, rather than wait to deploy directly onto Polkadot?

### Understanding the Value of Expecting Chaos
Chaos flies in the face of prediction. It often does more than one would expect - outcomes are unpredictable, and no amount of testing can account for these outcomes. This philosophy has been adapted by a number of organizations without the tech sector, in a practice known as Chaos Engineering

Because the interactions of users with a canary protocol maintain real world risk, users do not act as though they are in a test environment. Instead, they act as real users would, taking on risk in a blind setting that allows the protocols to act as they will when they are fully launched. This means that the course of execution by protocols that launch a canary network prepare them dutifully for the institutional-scale execution available to protocols that eventually launch on [[Polkadot]].

### Who might be interested in being a user on a Kusama canary network?

The options for parachains to pick from on Kusama are at this time plentiful, and the competition is fierce. As of writing, Kusama parachain slot auctions are in full force, and all slots appear on route to being filling in the near future. The total value locked in crowdloans and self-bond for parachain slots on Kusama is currently a total of 9.2mKSM (about 2.9bUSD) tokens locked in either active auctions or in crowdloans.

Barring this, there is a tremendous amount of development that is happening on the Kusama network - with some projects launching and seeing immediate utility. The [Moonbeam/Moonriver team](link) were seen to have an immediate effect on the Polkadot ecosystem through their support of an [[EVM]]-compatible substrate chain that allows users to deploy fully Ethereum native Solidity applications with minimal alterations to code, which in turn resulted in a high valuation for Moonriver's MOVR toke
