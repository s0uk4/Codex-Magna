Notable is his formation in the study of Social Contract Theory - that a 'state' comes into being through the associative aggreement of groups of individuals into a mutually beneficial and agreed upon interdependency - such that with sovereign bodies as part of a state, the state must serve constituents, and that as members of the state, no individual may supercede their value to the state by contrast to the needs and value of other individuals.
