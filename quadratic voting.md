# What is Quadratic Voting?
## Evergreen Description
A voting system that aims to demonstrate not only the support for a particular position, but also the direction and conviction of the the vote. This voting system requires that voting takes place in a voting market, in which voters use tokens to support their positions, and the number of votes that can be used by a single individual increases in cost for each vote that is posed on a quadratic curve:

| number of votes | cost of vote |
| --------------- | ------------ |
| 1               | 1            |
| 2               | 4            |
| 3               | 9            |
| 4               | 16           |
| 5               | 25           |

As a result, each vote is more expensive than the last, meaning that the cost of influencing a market-based democratic environment becomes that much more expensive to perform with each subsequent vote. The direct benefit of this is that if someone has voted multiple times, the cost of the votes goes up exponentially so that conviction from a single party becomes obvious, and credibility of the position may become more apparent as a result of that conviction.
