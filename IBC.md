# What is IBC?
## Evergreen Description
IBC is the Inter Blockchain Communication format operated by Cosmos. It allows blockchains to interoperate with one another in the Cosmos space assuming that the chain operates with basic design principles (such as the Cosmos SDK or Tendermint) allowing them to pass transaction messages between one another. Messages are passed through relay nodes, a operatively rewardless (and thankless) element of the cosmos ecosystem that enables messages to be sent and received.
### What are some potential issues with IBC?
There is no incentive to run relayer nodes - you do not get paid to run them in order to relay message data between chains. This is the subject of controversy within [[Cosmos]] as members work to create value accrual to the $ATOM token, but pulling treasury allocations from all connected chains may incentivize a staked rate allowing for relayers to run incentivized (as of Dec 2021).
