# What is a validator?
A validator is a virtual machine that engages in the practice of consensus-building with a number of other virtual machines who then continuously script the consensus into a distributed ledger so that transactions can be publicly trusted and act as a record of intermediation between parties without having to hold the assets of the exchange itselve.
