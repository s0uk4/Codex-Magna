# What is anarchism?
## Evergreen Description
Anarchism exists orthogonal to social structure - in that anarchism is a desire to instead pursue total autonomy in the individual. True anarchism abhors even the idea of ownership, but only to the respect of appreciating that which can be uniquely one's own and need not be shared. It does not incurr a demand to share in what one possesses, but rather to keep one's hands open to accepting what is offered and to offer in return what little you may have.

Oftentimes there is a conflation between this and [[libertarianism]] positions that believe that total autonomy includes ownership to which an individual has the right to control.  Anarchism instead posits a radical antithetical to the idea of ownership. [[Privacy]] is not a right but instead an agreement. Anarchist thought abhors institutions because they are a form of ownership that takes control from the individual, thus removing their autonomy.
