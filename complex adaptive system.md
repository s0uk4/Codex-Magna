# What is a Complex Adaptive System?
## Evergreen Description
A complex adaptive system is a form of structure in which the interactions of internal components allow it to dynamically respond to changes in the environment around it, but the behavior of the system is not predictable according to the behavior of the individual components.

A good example of this would be an ant colony - ant colonies are capable of responding to novel situations by virtue of the inflows that individual ants can bring into the larger colony response mechanism - but an individual ant will not reveal what the larger systemic response of the colony will be. Changes at the level of the individual ant can, however, have larger ecosystemic impacts, but the result is nonlinear.
