## Evergreen Description:
Human Values have high [[Kolmogorov complexity]] - they cannot be summed through a simple set of rules or compressed. **Most human choices can be compressed into the desire to survive - but you can't compress the human experience into this desire.** Any sufficiently complex entity that can be defined as an Artificial General Intelligence will still not be able to grasp the relative complexity of human value due to the complexity of the concept.

## Notes
A list of values must necessarily encapsulate a majority of the human experience.
- natural selection and the psychological drive to continue to execute self-preservation.
	- terminal values cannot be transmuted between one another
	- all values are morally relevant - there is no overarching principle of ethics because seeking this out would be reductive
- underappreciation of bad metaethics
	- moral discourse can be about a coherent subject matter, without all possible minds and agents necessarily finding the truths about that subject matter to be psychologically compelling. see [expected paperclip optimizer](https://terbium.io/2020/05/paperclip-maximizer/)
	- judgment on the goal of ordering values and the examination of relativistic value systems - that which makes a thing important to another thing is, indeed, an irreducible construct.
- any sufficiently complex entity that can be defined as an  AGI will still not be able to grasp the relative [[Kolmogorov complexity]] of human value due to the complexity of the concept.
	- an Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) that does not understand human values will create a world that is devoid of them.
