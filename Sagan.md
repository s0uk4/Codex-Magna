# What is Sagan?
## Evergreen Description
Sagan intends to be [[canary network]] for the [[Cosmos]] development space, a space that intends to offer locally sanctioned shared security from a permissioned set of vetted validators. 

Different from [[Kusama]], Sagan intends to offer a way for protocols native to the space to live beyond the bounds of the experimental space that it has to offer, eventually allowing them to live in the wider [[Cosmos]] space whilst still having had access to real-world asset space.

## Notes
direct 1-1 pairing doesn't work
- cosmos is robust
	- cosmos is elusive, opaque and difficult to make sense of if you're coming in - interchain security will be a big deal
- ambitious roadmap of V3 layered security
	- version 2 also offers some of these dealings?
		- the road to Version 3 is going to have a lot of value accrual to ATOM
		- given the process, frictions for 
		- IC has the capacity to reduce friction for network interaction
		- Sagan allows networks to interact at this level (v3)
	- Sagan is a way for early stage projects, because it affords insights
	- Sagan provides a tight validator set for spin-up.
		- Version 3 - interchain would spin up within Sagan.

capable teams who can run their own validator sets - how do we derisk certain aspects of innovation so that there are new staking mechanisms. 

Moyukh - mentioned something about tUSD demoninations and the adoption of the currency.

convention of a canary network? - is a canary network a primitive?

Jin 
- Kusama can't run faster because they mirrored distribution 
	- they were already centralized 
Cosmos hub is super decentralized 
- Sagan would be more centralized but you could blow it up if you wanted - 21 nodes on the network.

Blowing up the networks - if you're going to blow up the network 

11 validator backbone - globally present validators who will anchor state, then 10 additional validators to build up from there.



HUGEly thinking forward about the way that they are growing networks
