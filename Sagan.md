# What is Sagan?
## Evergreen Description
Sagan is a [[Cosmos]]-based iteration environment comparable to [[canary network]]s in which [[blockchain]]s will be able to benefit from shared security as they work toward the creation of a viable economy. This would allow projects to vy for execution space on the basis that they are under use, rather than trying to drum up the infrastructural demand to have people take part.

The concept here would be that the creation of a low-friction execution environment would afford projects real-economy experiment space that would quickly decentralise the networks as they intend to build it. This would allow projects to decentralize from the outset with those who choose to work with them, so that when they reach 'scale' they did not need to go through the ardor of focusing on security throughout this process.

## Notes
#### Feb 2022 Meeting
blockchain requests - singleton launch
- want to know what the challenges are for validators when they are starting to set up a chain
- how do you make things easier for chains?
	- restrictions with itnerchain shared security
	- reducing friction for deployment
	- earlier spot in project market execution to work with validators
- market / governance facilitation for projects
- focus on the earlier stage primarily
	- pluggable VM space - dual token models and the fee token. The fee token could be swappable.
	- fee tokens would be accrual from other validated chains

#### Dec meeting

direct 1-1 pairing doesn't work
- cosmos is robust
	- cosmos is elusive, opaque and difficult to make sense of if you're coming in - interchain security will be a big deal
- ambitious roadmap of V3 layered security
	- version 2 also offers some of these dealings?
		- the road to Version 3 is going to have a lot of value accrual to ATOM
		- given the process, frictions for 
		- IC has the capacity to reduce friction for network interaction
		- Sagan allows networks to interact at this level (v3)
	- Sagan is a way for early stage projects, because it affords insights
	- Sagan provides a tight validator set for spin-up.
		- Version 3 - interchain would spin up within Sagan.

capable teams who can run their own validator sets - how do we derisk certain aspects of innovation so that there are new staking mechanisms. 

Moyukh - mentioned something about tUSD demoninations and the adoption of the currency.

convention of a canary network? - is a canary network a primitive?

Jin 
- Kusama can't run faster because they mirrored distribution 
	- they were already centralized 
Cosmos hub is super decentralized 
- Sagan would be more centralized but you could blow it up if you wanted - 21 nodes on the network.

Blowing up the networks - if you're going to blow up the network 

11 validator backbone - globally present validators who will anchor state, then 10 additional validators to build up from there.



HUGEly thinking forward about the way that they are growing networks
