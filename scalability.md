# What is scalability?
## Evergreen Description
Scalability is the ability for a system to operate at multiple scales - it's not a natural process and is something exclusive to fabricated systems. The core idea behind building a scalable system is to predict a system's ability to function at all scales by designing it so that it is not fragile as it grows.

One issue with this way of thinking is believing that scalability means robusticity, which it does not. A scalable system can grow quickly, but because it relies heavily on short path length, no complexity can emerge throughout the network due to the distributed nature of the paths between connections - it is not unified. Scalability as a rule banishes the ability for system to change as they grow, since a scalable system is really just a simple set of rules governing connections - if there is an issue with this path connection when it is at 'scale' - the system is highly vulnerable.

## Notes
### Tsing, A
Scalability banishes systems changing as they grow - meaning that there is no capacity for a system to change in response to the environments it encounters at difference sizes. 

This encourages alienation, because it fuels a desire for [[self-contained individual]]s to work interchangeably across all scales; the individual and their differences is not material to the 'scales' at which a system desires to work.
