# What is 'salvage'
## Evergreen Description
First proposed by Tsing in '[[The Mushroom at the End of the World]]', salvage is the creation of capital accumulation from sources that do not start within capitalism. 

Salvage turns extraction into profict by creating inflows for systems that require resources and into which wealth can accumulate, but it is inherently at the edges of a capitalist system. It is the interface at which capital infrastructure connects to the resources needed in order to create commodity.

Examples of this are resource extraction, capability stereotyping, the use of indigenous knowledge to further capital accumulation, the utility of intellect and insight, 

'Free trade', then, is not a characteristic of capitalism, but rather a feature that exists where capitalism seeks to prey on the value created in salvage accumulation. Self-contained individual actors (a capitalist construction) can then work to gauge the capital demand within systems that require their knowledge. Salvage is free trade defined in relationship to capitalism, where the purity of seeking our demands can coelesce with what value individuals can offer from their assemblages.
