# What is 'The Mushroom at the End of the World'?
## Evergreen Description
This is am ethnography by Anna Louenhoupt Tsing framing the state of growth and adaptation that exists in the liminal spaces between where [[capitalism]] and [[salvage]] exist. She does so by outlining the experience off matsutake mushroom pickers, who tend to forests by maintaining them in a constant state of disturbance, finding that it is in these spaces that adaptation seems to unfurl for the [[self-contained individual]].
