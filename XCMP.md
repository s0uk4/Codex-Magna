# What is XCMP?
## Evergreen Description
XCMP stands for Cross-chain [[message passing format]], a format that allows chains connected by the [[Polkadot]] ecosystem to communicate with one another using the [[relay chain]], which in turn provides a closed [[interoperability]] environment for all connected [[parachain]]s.
### Issues with XCMP
One of the core problems encountered by running XCMP is that it requires you to work within the Polkadot ecosystem in order to chain the advantages of shared security. XCMP is not available to sovereign chains that have not gone through the process of securing a [[parachain]] slot on either [[Polkadot]] or [[Kusama]].
