# What is Interchain Security?

The interchain foundation proposed to unlink staking on the [[Gravity Bridge]] in order to bring more value to $ATOM holders by setting the staking token for the Gravity Bridge as $ATOM and shifting the $GRAV token into a governance position. This should in theory provide ad-hoc security to sovereign blockchains operating in the [[Cosmos]] ecosystem.

## Notes

resources - when Althea said that they wanted to work on their own system - billy was scrambling as a result because they don't want to compete.

interchain security - shared security - hardwired security vs cosmos - interchain follows with this, three versions

1. Cosmos hub is the secondary validator set for relay security, two different nodes communicating over IBC - normally staking token would be on both networks, but on IC you only need staking on one side, you keep track of the other validator set on the other chain and cosmos validator set is tracking what is on the cosmos hub - staking on cosmos hub - exporting the validator set to other chains.
	1. More of a scaling solution for the hub itself - allows horizontal scaling because you doubled block availability on two chains, therefore doubling throughput. Also separate chain can have its own dev cycle, cosmos hub can then have its own upgrade and dev cycle separate from sovereign chain
	2. more for core users
2. more choice
3. Consumer chain can then combine staking between chains, layered security. - mesh network - Blockchain to blockchain network
	1. if one stops producing, the other can take over

Gravity bridge
- bridge network has higher degree of security - attractive attack vector, good candidate for V1 security.
- ICF is quiet about changing the method
	- eventually GRAV token would shift from being staking token to being a governance token, which then the ATOM will become the staking token for gravity bridge
	- ATOM needs more value accrual, this would be a way to do so
	- once network is running, not up to Althea to change the tech, they can include it in the dialogue, but they want to raise the issue so that the gravity chain validators will be interested in supporting this position
- participation by ICF as a validator themselves - wanting to show that they are part of gravity bridge and making sure 
- Ethereum governance tokens - launching tokens for governance was laughed at, it's now seen as quite valuable
	- governance tokens *should* be seen as valuable, GRAV could be a case study for value in showing the upside of interchain security
	- privileged network because you're a part of the network
	- ICF/Althea relationship
