# What is evolution?
## description
Evolution is the process by which the complex adaptive process of iteration creates systems best suited to their surrounding conditions. Evolution as a concept preceded was by Darwin, whose observation was not that there is a linear path toward supremacy in species but rather that evolution is an enmeshed adaptive process, contextual to the environments that surround it.

## Misinterpretations
Misinterpretations of evolution have led to the linear thinking that believes evolution is an exploration of supremacy, i.e. that survival of the fittest is competitive, rather than interpreting the question of 'fitness' to mean 'what best fits into a particular ecological niche'.
