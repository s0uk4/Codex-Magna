# What is elaboration?
## Evergreen Description
Elaboration allows us to expand on the thoughts that we have by drawing on the network of connections that lie between thoughts, thus allowing us to anchor the information in the context of the network of connections within which it lies.

The distinct advantage of this is that it allows information to be expanded upon and the connections grown - meaning that over time elaboration is a core part of what leads to insight.

### Asking questions as an inroad to insight
When we ask questions before we have the answers, we do the work on trying to find a network of solutions, so that we are primed to make them when we do indeed find the solutions.
