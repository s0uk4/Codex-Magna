# what is network resilience?
## Evergreen Description
A core tenet of network growth is recognizing the importance of small world systems in growing/maintaining a network. Strogatz references this in Sync when he mentions that small-world networks (strong convictions, weakly held) with a low degree of randomness and high [[clustering]] are best positioned for [[network resilience]]. 

Therefore networks that establish a number of small-world connections are able to sustain their network volume more comfortably. Highly-connected individual nodes act as information highways for local clusters, so that the network has strong long-distance connections across shorter [[path length]], leading in turn to small-world connectivity as information travels across less steps to get to it's destination.

This allows the network to be well-connected across distances and increases resiliency, though only if the small number of well-connected individuals are kept safe from disconnection to the rest of the network. Models have proven that the removal of highly-connected individuals has an outsized effect on the stability of the network as the smaller sub-networks they are a part of become unconnected islands, while the removal of less connected nodes has very little effet on overall network stability.
