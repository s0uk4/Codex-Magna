## In a sentence:
Finance.vote aims to essentially create a DAO engine that would help deploy other DAOs by providing tooling in the shape of NFT-based governance, in addition to a number of other offerings. It is headed by Nick Almond, and part of the governance deployment takes the shape of semantic governance, in which decisions are made using hashmaps that dictate the most important path in a group's decisions, rather than focusing on the decisions of a single individual.
