## Evergreen Description
Active inference is an intelligence model that helps describe a group of interacting components with the aims of cooperatively alligning group processes in a local group's contribution to a larger system.

This process depends on the overlap of ability between parties that participate in the act of work, and all share an FONT ([[ontology]], narrative, Formal documents, Tools) framework for accomplishing the group's tasks in the collective act of sensemaking how to interact with their environment in the act of working.
## Notes
- FONT, composed of
	- *Narrative* - the unifying story that links together the reason for a group doing work together
	- *Ontology* - meaning-making in the act of cooperation, a team asking themselves what the meaning of their work is
	- *Formal documents* - These are the databases that store aligning information for a team
	- *Tools *- The functions and structures that are used in order to do the work
- In order to have an effective team structure, a team must share qualities that guarantee their coordination - *a shared organizational culture,  mission, narrative that ties a team's work together.*
- There are three kinds of alignments:
	- Ontological allignment is found in strict processes - sets of rules that determine how the work is done, with little flexibility.
	- Intimate trust alignment is found in groups whose work is dependent on collective thinking, usually through a consistent relationship between team members.
	- Narrative alignment comes as a result of exploring a culture, a narrative, and a mission.  This is the ONFT structure and allows teams to be flexible in their overlaps of working together.
- Formal documents:
	- i. morning documents - creating narrative alignment and updates
	- ii. EOD documents - providing closure to the end of the day, indicating progress & where work needs to be done in order to proceed
	- iii. Monday Documents - week-by-week narrative alignment; "where are we in the larger picture of the work being done?"
	- iv. Friday documents - closing up the week to understandd the work that was done throughout the week and the progress that came from it.
