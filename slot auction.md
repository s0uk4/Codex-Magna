# What is a Slot Auction?
## Evergreen Description
A slot auction is the process by which a [[parachain]] earns access to the [[Polkadot]]or [[Kusama]] execution layers. Chains that want to leverage the shared security of the base chain must raise funds in DOT or KSM to be locked for predetermined periods of time (dependent on the desired slot duration).

Toward the end of the auction period, the auction enters a 'candle period' wherein the tokens that are raised for each chain can increase but a post-determined block is chosen at which the balances are proven in order to select a winner. This is in an effort to prevent bid sniping by parachain communities as the auction comes to a close, encouraging contributors to contribute the most toward the beginning of the candle period.
