# What is Deployable Complexity?
## Evergreen Description
Deployable complexity is the ability to execute solutioning events around the utility function of those who understand the capacities of using complexity to solve problems. Direct effects of beign able to do so would be team differentiation in problem solving for urgency scenarios, s/a [[disasters]] - so that the unforeseen problem can be examined both looking forward and backward in time, as well as from multiple perspectives, ideally with the intent to surround the problem with the most accomodating and contextually appropriate solution using [[active inference]].
