# What is a Polkadot proxy account, and what are some strategies that can be used to delegate votes?
## Evergreen description
A proxy account allows an account to perform certain functions for another account on their behalf, without ever actually taking ownership over the tokens itself by denying it any withdrawal capabilities. There are a limited set of qualities that a controller account can take on. They require a small amount in order to create the account, and amount of a single proxy deposit boils down as a product of the sum of current ProxyDepositBases (20.008DOT) and a ProxyDepositFactors (.033DOT) per account: $$ProxyDepositBase+(ProxyDepositFactor*NumAccts)$$ .

## You can pick from the following list of proxies:
* "Any"
* Non-Transfer
* Governance
* Staking
* Identity Judgement
* Auction
* Anonymous
* Time Delayed
