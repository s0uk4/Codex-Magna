# What is a phase state?
## Evergreen Description
A change of state occurs when matter is converted from one physical state to another. For example, when water is heated, it changes from a liquid to a gas â€” when cooled water will eventually freeze into a solid: ice. A change of state is usually accompanied by a change in temperature and/or pressure.

Limiting this definition to physical phenomenae is ineffective, in that other systems also go through phase state changes knows as [[phase transitions]]. These can happen at any level, as understood by the comparability of cultural environments to physical environments in the [[network effect]] of associated systems.
