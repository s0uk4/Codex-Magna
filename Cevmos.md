# What is Cevmos?
Cevmos is a three-layered solution for scaling the Ethereum Virtual Machine into a state of scalability. The name derives from the three components that make up the stack: **C**elestia, **EV**mos, and Cosm**OS**.

It uses [[Celestia]] as the settlement layer, [[Evmos]] as the consensus layer, and then any given rollup can be connected through the [[Evmos ]] smart contract environment.

## What does this mean?

It means that there is an easy way to scale the [[EVM]] that doesn't result on chain dependence in the same way that has people investing toward minimums, or competing for space.
