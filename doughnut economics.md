# What is Doughnut economics?
## Evergreen Description
Proposed by Kate Raworth, doughnut economics is a framework proposed to regard the performance of an economy by the extent to which the needs of people are met without overshooting Earth's ecological ceiling. The main goal of the new model is to re-frame economic problems and set new goals. 

In this model, an economy is considered prosperous when all twelve social foundations are met without overshooting any of the nine ecological ceilings, and not falling too far into the inner ring of social impacts. This situation is represented by the area between the two rings, considered by its creator as the safe and just space for humanity.
