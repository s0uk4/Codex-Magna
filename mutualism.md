# what is Mutualism?
## Evergreen Description
Mutualism a separate approach from capitalism and socialism that focuses on the meaningful preservation of public [[institution]]s for the good of those who use them. This would mean that public goods institutions can self-fund rather that depend on funding from other, more massive public institutions (s/a government) - usually doing so by providing a community need that is paid for, funding the rest of an institution's operations.
