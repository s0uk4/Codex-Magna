# What is 'precarity'?
## Evergreen Description
Per Tsing - precarity is the 'boundary' between states, similar to [[thresholds]] that exist between states of stability. It is within these liminal spaces that the [[freedom]] preceding [[complexity]] is found. 

Tenuous as the space is, it remains the most robust space within which flexibility of movement can generate new states of being. Within precarity are generated the [[boundary objects]] that precede the formation of new memes and extant systems that seek stability.
