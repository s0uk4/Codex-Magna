# We need a prioritization category system comprised of 5 well defined categories

- Purpose and Mission [1-5]
	- How does this align with the interests that we have an an organization?
	- How does it align with our thesis for how the space is evolving (this will be heavily informed by the insights gained by the whole org)
	- What kinds of bets do we want to take, and how does this opportunity feed into those bets?
- Integrity of the team [1-5]
	- Are they responsive?
	- What is their project history?
	- Have they properly scoped out their roadmap?
	- Do they articulate our necessary involvement at a sufficient level?
	- Are they invested in our participation?
- Financial / Revenue expectation [1-5]
	- Do we have a token allocation agreement with them?
	- What is the expected staking return? In the short term? In the long term?
	- What is the expected AUS?
	- What other agreements do we have with them, and how much are they worth, if executed?
- Reputational awareness [1-5]
	- Is our involvement guaranteed to make us look good in the space?
	- Will our lack of involvement hurt our reputation?
	- Are there opportunities to increase our reputation through connection to this network?
- Operational complexity [1-5]
	- How difficult is it to operate on this network?
		- Is it easy to run? complex?
	- How much involvement is needed from us on the testnet?
	- Are their barriers to our involvement?

### Additionally:
In order to effectively prioritize the networks that we're looking at taking on, we have to recognize that there is a divide in our positioning - if we seek to continue engaging with and growing through our connections to institutions, our intention is to expand our staking operations in order to take on larger institution-grade blockchains. 

With this in mind, we would concentrate on the opportunities that align with those interests - blockchains that have a guaranteed return based on the opportunity for revenue with those protocols.

If, however, we are more interested in taking a wider approach to the space and evolution of the technology therein, we have to take a wider approach to the the way that we are investing our efforts so that we're engaging more intentionally with the projects we intend to take on.

If we aim to take on the latter - we are choosing to focus on the growth of the space as a whole, and are acknowledging the importance of our role as a major validator that is taking part in the process of growing the blockchain economy. We are well positioned to continue expanding within the space as a majority provider for emerging cryptoeconomies, but we as-yet need to evaluate where our intentions lie.
