## Can financial instruments save the world?

If humans are really and truly economic creatures, they would be rational. Being that they aren't - it should be evident that the work humans have put into changing the planet are in alignment with irrationality, not rationality. It is because of this that our use of the climate is something that has lead us to be fundamentally wasteful creatures - we don't know how to use what we have efficiently, because we've never had to consider the possibility of scarcity.

This may be the fundamental issue that we run into when considering the logic of our own collapse. Scarcity is baked into nature. When a biome reaches a state of scarcity, one of two things happen: either the community dependent on the scarce resources disbands in search of other resources, or there is competition over the resource. The latter is less likely - because it is a battle over something that will disappear, so being capricious as it disappears does not result in outsized reward.

In fact, humans are the only species that prizes what are known as 'ephemeral goods' - resources that have no intrinsic value but for their scarcity. Gold, diamonds, even bitcoin, are not examples of naturally occurring events in nature. They are wholly human in design and logic - a capriciousness imposed by rarity alone.

If economic arguments outline several strains of logic, especially those of supply and demand, of cost and benefit - we leave out too much information that is important to the system.

# How might financial instruments actually solve climate change?

Let's get the frustrating part of this conversation out of the way first - there's no world where creating a financial incentive for working on human-caused climate change will lead to solving 'the problem'. Truthfully, the one greatest thing that will solve this issue is collective action, by all parties at all levels of society, working to prevent the worst from happening - because yes, climate change is here, and we basically don't have a feasible way of stopping it.

With this out of the way, we can address the next question: *can* financial instruments contribute to solving issues with climate change? If the key term here is contribute - then yes, absolutely. In fact, there are innumerable projects that are doing just that, backed by strong theory, really requiring nothing more than adoption to get them started.

Let's consider one of the greater barriers to solving the issue of climate change - financial incentives to those who have done the brunt of the damage to this planet. Oftentimes the blame is laid on a collective ignorance of the effect we have been having on the climate, so with that collective blame has been a collective call to action that conveniently sidesteps the most egregious culprits of carbon dioxide emissions (corporations and industry) and focuses instead on individuals as the place where change 'can happen'. Regardless of the political ire that this can inspire, the other structure waylaying measurable action is economy - there's just too much money in putting useful resources to work.

The most profitable economies on the planet are resource extraction and utilization. A whopping [number] worth of raw materials are mined/extracted/processed each year. We've seen distinct advantage in the use of these resources - fossil fuels are a dream material. 

The chemical qualities of raw oil are so tremendous in utility that, were they not actively destroying the planet, everyone would champion them. There's almost no denying this. There is almost nothing you can't do with oil, and it has accelerated the progress of our human race tremendously in a short period of time. This has come at a cost of creating an extremely wasteful culture around the material that we are now finally [clawing back](link to material about lowering plastic products), in addition to the contributions that petroleum as a fuel source adds to the atmosphere in terms of carbon dioxide emissions.

Second to this is coal, which still constitutes an [extremely high portion](another link) of electricity generation worldwide, followed quickly by minerals extraction and refinement for use in industry (which happens in most cases to use electricity and/or materials generated by the prior two in processing).

There's a lot of money in raw material extraction and use - it's essentially what we do as a species. There's little wonder that we can be quite closely compared to ants in that regard. We use the world around us to build things that serve us. We have done all of this in the name of growing our footprint as a species, and it turns out we've been largely successful - it's just that it was a carbon footprint, and it's getting bigger all the time.

Despite what stock tickers will tell you, the underlying economic value of operating our resource-driven economy is enormous, and will be (has been) extremely difficult to deviate from. It's a tale that is drilled into us, that price meets where demand is high, and demand will not go down any time soon.

After considering all of this it's actually a little hard to imagine that there's anything that will stop us from prioritizing extraction. But that's also only if we approach everything from a pure economic mindset, which (luckily) humans required to think within. Those who hold the most influence over the decisions of how money is used in our society (and how they make more of it) have the greatest impact on these numbers, rather than any number counted within the gross majority of society that cannot come close to conceiving of such wealth. With economic mindset comes an incentives-based approach to modeling intention - and here we do indeed see how human these decisions can be.

The issue I have with this thinking is that asking if wealth is good. I think it is? I don't think we really have a choice about having it - we're not going to see massive wealth redistribution, because we've seen that experiment and it just doesn't work. Give people enough to survive with and you lift the bottom, that's really the most important work you could do. 

Would a financialized climate incentive market make rich people richer? Yeah, maybe, but at least we'd save the planet, and I'm (for the most part) willing to put up with that so that Montana isn't constantly on fire when I want to go see mountains.
