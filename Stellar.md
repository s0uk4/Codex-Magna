# What is Stellar?
## Evergreen Description
Stellar is a federated consensus chain that does cross-border remittance. It does not have direct delegated staking and $lumens are not used to attest to validators, instead $lumens are simply a unit of exchange between wallets.

## Notes
easy cross border paymemnts

- support of technical assistance
- grants and loans 

mission is to increase 
help businesses make easier cross border payments
- infrastructure
- builder access


stellar is federated consensus - there is no staking infra

interested in helping with Stellar infrastructure
- network nodes on network
- make it easier to run stellar nodes for people
	- potential opportunity to check on how frustrating it is to run nodes
		- grant for evaluation
		- 
	- offer a grant to run nodes - ongoing grant
		- node for a service operation
		- people pay a monthly fee - exchanges, remitances services
		- 
	- control over tx finality, running a node, finality is instant
		- single asset issuance so that there are no soft forks
		- necessary for compliance, credibility of individuality
- Validators are known entities
- offering digital assets

Stellar has federated consensus, as such there is no direct staking infrastructure. People don't 'stake' to us, rather Stellar is mostly a remmittance service for p2p payment that is then backed by the ledger to which validators submit validity proofs. All validators are known entities, and either do so for free (?) or are paid out a grant by the Stellar Foundation.

There are essentially two opportunities here:
- Assess the ease of node operation for the Stellar Foundation and seek to provide more concise documentation to make node operation easier for people to participate. We would be receive a grant for this work.
- Operate a node on behalf of the Stellar Foundation, the operation of which would be paid for by Stellar Foundation in whatever form we'd like (I mentioned that AUS is a big driver for us, they mentioned they could pay our the grant in fiat or $LUMENS). This grant could be paid out to us on a rolling basis (month-to-month).

I didn't ask how much they were willing to pay out in the form of a grant for either of these opportunities (doesn't really seem like my place), but it seems at present these are the options we have available.
