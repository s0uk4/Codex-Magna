# How might build out a launch product for protocols?

Accessed: Oct 2021
Source: conversation with AJC
State: #todo 

## Evergreen description
If are able to identify all the pieces of the process, we can effectively define the process by which rolling out effective launches is a useful tool that we can help other organizations with - launch-execution-as-a-service. 

We would effectively hire out project execution managers to help with successful testnet deployment through mainnet so that we are providing value to their entire process and can as a result argue to have contributed meaningfully to the protocol at the fundamental level and through network maintenance.

## Notes
### launch plan as a product
- what do we think that we've learned?
	- how do we build out our relationships with protocols so that they know how to continue growing?
	- launch plan execution
		- two phases of launch - testnet teams versus mainnet teams
		- handoff points - who owns the work when it gets past a certain stage? 
	- here's a collaborative discussion on ideal ways to launch
		- IRT - Instantaneous Remote Teams - DAO that hires people for roles
		- first step would be a conversation, subsequent relationship building would offer more 
	- community run****
