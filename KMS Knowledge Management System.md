You cannot search Notion across fields, and the KM not only allows you to search, but it allows you to search across all of the protocols, simultaneously. The KM is a powerful database that will not get bogged down by the amount of information that you put into it (which is something that happens with Notion).

It will also allow us to manage the content that is being put in on a recurring basis to make sure that it's up to date, so that we don't need to have someone whose job will literally be to check notion for clarity, because the means through which each protocol is filled in is standardized.

Last, it's going to make sure that the articles we write never start with a blank page. In the long run, it's going to mean that we can spit out insights on the protocols that we're a part of, so that we can produce content of any calibre, using the system as a backbone for putting it together.

Also, it means that we can solve for cross-functional issues within and between departments, where information is being produced by multiple parties, but that isn't being checked for completion - there have been multiple instances of people doing repeated work because Notion simply doesn't make it easy to check what has been made, and where it was put. This means everything is in one place, and most importantly, it shows you *when it's not there*.

- all the token distribution pages

## Knowledge Management System
- No dev resources
- other depts to work on
- only for our team
	- time that we dedicate
	- time investment and ROI on effort
- no one will use the KM in the current form
	- no slack access
	- no community (?)
	- 
- the project is too grandiose
	- MVP - network library is valuable if we do it in Notion
