# Staking Hub: Axelar AMA

## What is [[Axelar]]?
Funded by a notable investors such as Polychain, the "Axelar is  universal interoperability network securely connecting all blockchain ecosystems, applications, assets, and users.  goal is to enable crypto users to simply and securely use any asset in any application on any platform. 

[...] For developers our goal is to enable them to simply focus on developing the best dapps they can on the networks most appropriate for their use cases but without the concern of being locked into a single ecosystem or missing out on liquidity from other ecosystems."
- Sergey Gorbunov

"Instead of using centralized bridges that enable point-to-point connections between blockchains, you can think of Axelar as a decentralized overlay network that enables cross chain transfer, routing and delivery between any and all blockchains."

- Kate S
## Quick Takes
Axelar is a network built for use by everyone who can take advantage from interoperability, whether network builders, dApp builders, or the users themselves who want to move assets between bridged locations. The intent of running Axelar is to provide the means to work interoperably, regardless of the protocol stack or environment needed.

"At the end of the day, we want to enable users to use their assets in any application on any chain. This requires building a tech technical stack consisting of both routing and application-level protocols which we're working on." - Kate S

## Details about the network
- Anyone within the network can act as a relayer for transactions within the network, in order to bias the system toward liveness - Node operators do not need to run a validator on the recipient chain of a transaction, but rather can run a standard RPC node in order to carry the transaction.
- Axelar aims to move assets between any two systems, and is aiming to start out with a strong group of networks . At the outset Axelar will be [[EVM]] and Cosmos compatible (it is built on the Tendermint SDK), but plans to expand to Terra, Moonbeam, Avalanche with many more on the horizon.

## Staking details
- In order to affirm the transaction state between two separate chains, Axelar performs a stepwise transaction to to confirm transactions on either side of interaction between endpoints. The validators on the network then vote on the events from the first chain in order to execute the resulting transaction on the second chain.
- The network will start out with 50 validators, but may aim to support between 100-200, a number that will be refined on the current testnet.
## Token details
The AXL token will be used as a fee-capture mechanism within the Axelar protocol, rewarding validators for processing transactions and as the underlying asset to measure the work done within the community. Validators and stakers will be paid out through both fee capture and inflation-based rewards.

"Axelar‚Äôs token will be used to reward validators for their efforts in maintaining a decentralized network. It will also be used to incentivize other forms of community development and engagement. Every validator can opt in to vote on events from a specific chain and earn rewards for voting on events from that chain. Each validator isn't however required to vote on every chain but only the chains they opt into." - Kate S.

Axelar will be supported on both Cosmostation and the Keplr wallet at launch, both of which will support staking.

## Price-setting between chains
"We'll set a minimal gas fee, but as the cross-chain interop network usage grows, users will be required to pay accordingly. What we're trying to do from day 1 though is make it easy for users to use our front-end without having to learn how to operate the axelar network. 

So the fee will be collected at the source chain only (e.g., you want to move ATOM to Ethereum, you just pay in ATOMs) and our front-end/dapp will pay all other fees along the way for the user."
-S. Gorbunov.
## Governance
Since Axelar is based on the Cosmos SDK, it will support open governance on chain, but will also encourage off-chain governance in discussions and meetings in order to facilitate discourse. 
## Security
Axelar is decentralized from the outset - Axelar Gateways are maintained by network validators that can permissionlessly join the active set if they have sufficient stake to contribute to the security of the protocol.
## The Future in Axelar
While cross-chain token transfer is one future that Axelar is pursuing, it aims to increase the cross-chain capacities of the protocol so that it is can exponentially increase the the underlying value proposition of increasing cross-chain application stacks. Eventually, this could mean that in order to build out their implementations, developers will be able to construct their applications 

"the network will eventually support transferring of all types of assets from NFTs to staking derivations. You will also be able to perform more-general cross-chain calls across the smart contracts. I.e., a contract on chain A can issue a transaction to perform a state transaction on a contract on chain B. the network will facilitate and route the request appropriately."
-S. Gorbunov

"If you think about how we're using the Internet today, we're not thinking about "interoperability" across networks. Right now, for instance, thousands of us are interacting with a single application, [Telegram], from all over the world. Messages are sent dozens of networks and delivered to the [Telegram] application. 

This relies on years of engineering and interop infra that was built in 90s-00s. We're not there for in the blockchain ecosystem. We need to build similar layers of routing, application-level protocols, and APIs to make this happen. 

When you will interact with an application in the blockchain ecosystem years from now, you'll probably be using some of the Axelar's interop protocols and infrastructure üòÅ. 

At the end of the day, we just make it easy for users to benefit from the entire ecosystem and not be locked in to a single provider."
-S Gorbunov
