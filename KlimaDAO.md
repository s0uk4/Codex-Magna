# What is Klima DAO?
## Evergreen Description
KlimaDAOâ€™s goal is to accelerate the price appreciation of carbon assets. A high price for carbon forces companies and economies to adapt more quickly to the realities of climate change, and makes low-carbon technologies and carbon-removal projects more profitable.

Through the KLIMA token, they will maximize value creation for our community and create a virtuous cycle of growth. Eventually, the KLIMA token (each backed by real, verified carbon assets) will function as a truly sustainable asset and medium-of-exchange, with real planetary value.
