## Summary
Decentralized Governance is the pursuit of an antifragile method for coordination that includes the proper concerned parties for the maintenance of a club or public good maintained by those who participate in a governed body. 
## Notes

The importance that we work toward DeGov with blockchain Governance

DeGov is necessary because it helps protocols grow carefully and ensures that public goods in the space are properly funded

Public Goods are research that improves the chain and its community, funded by treasuries.

Off-Chain Governance sometimes isn't possible because external assets can be controlled by on-chain smart contracts

Dangers of DeGov

vote buying, attackers, whales, coin-holder interests are prioritized
delegation of votes (letting someone else make te decision for you) can mean that you are not voting for decisions that you take part in:
* we have achieved unbundling: the borrower has governance power without economic interest, and the lender has economic interest without governance power**.
	* timelocks as in Polkadot - wrapped token workaround. timelocks are like a paywall.
* Why haven't attacks happened yet?
	* community spirit and mission
	* wealth concentration and overall coordination of decisions
	* immature markets.
* Limited governance
	* on-chain governance only for applications, not base layers
	* non-coin driven governance
	* Proof of personhood - kycing
	* Proof of participation
	* quadratic voting (OlympusDAO,[[finance.vote]]
		* reputation
* amazon
the expansion of infrastructure due to private growth is a root call for the advantages of centralized governance rather than [[DeGov]]

* Groups make better decisions than individuals - open-source libraries - charity vs public good
	* How true is this, really? #question 
* energy as a public good
* asynch meetings

* LZRS is a vector
	* Gospel - guiding companies to experiment with company restructuring for the internet era
* increase production of knowledge work through distributed system

* More cores have lower clock speed
	* trade-offs - less efficient, but more resilient
	* waiting on other nodes for activation and syncing (and bandwidth)
	* ramping
	* bringing people in to contribute to problem solving can actually scale systems way better than a centralized structure
* Prolific people do really well on the internet. People who constantly create and output will succeed.

		* Extreme ownership
		* pitching it to companies
