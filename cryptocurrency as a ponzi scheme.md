# Is cryptocurrency a ponzi scheme?
## Evergreen Description
Under the premise that all protocol are constructed with the intention for early adopters to benefit from the speculative value derived from later adopters entering speculation. If protocols are only seen with this in mind, then it absolutely exhibits ponzinomic qualities.

If fair-launch protocols existed, however (and afaik they don't, really) - this wouldn't be the case.
