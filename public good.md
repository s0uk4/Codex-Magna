# What are Public Goods?

The baseline definition for a public good is that it is non-rivalrous, non-exclusive, and limited in scope of effect. Public goods must not exclude anyone who chooses to use it, regardless of those who govern the good. Governance of a public good can be enforced by a limited and rivalrous party, but this governance does not constitute the good available to the 

A public good is held by those who use it, and must have low [[Kolmogorov complexity]] in how it does so, either through the parties that benefit from it's use, or from the systems that it upholds.

## What makes something a public good?
The first part of answering this comes from the need to define a [[public]] - where in a public is an [[organizational threshold]] defined by the maximum number of individuals from a community involved in coordination and conviviality, with as little as possible [[marginalization]] within the system.

In this manner, a public good is held as necessary for all those who participate in the [[conviviality]] of a particular system, such that their engagement with the system has a requirement of using a particular component within it.

The level of granularity necessary to define this threshold is defined with respect to the number of individuals within the system and the necessity of the structures to those who live within it. A '[[public]]' as an [[organizational threshold]] emerges from a lower organizational [[phase state]] by virtue of the dependence of those within the system relying upon it.
