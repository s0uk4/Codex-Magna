# What is Moonriver?

## Moonriver is
an EVM-compatible parachain native to the [[Kusama]] ecosystem and is the canary network to Moonbeam, allowing users to deploy smart contracts and Solidity-based applications seamlessly on top of the WASM runtime of a Substrate chain. Because this allows EVM applications to run without all the additional weight of gas fee finality on Ethereum, users can deploy applications with minimal changes to their Solidity code and enjoy the feeless and highly secure-consensus environment that Substrate has to offer.

## Details
### Tokenomic structure
- 10mMOVR on the network as ERC 20 tokens
- Metamask can be used to operate within the network, though there are other interaction forms including operating directly on chain.
- Tokens are used for:
	- commissions
	- staking
	- network operation fees
	- gas accounting
	- governance
### Node requirements
In order to deploy a node, a Moonriver validator must post a total of 1101MOVR. This is a 1MOVR confirmation transaction, a 100 AuthID signature, and a 1000MOVR minimum bond. 

The tokens then must be delegated by external parties and incurr a network-set 20% commission rate.
### Why did they pick [[Kusama]]?
The Moonbeam foundation chose to build in the Polkadot network because they appreciate the shared security model that these networks have to offer, as well as the cabilities of the canary chain network functionlity that allow you to test your frameworks in real-world settings.
