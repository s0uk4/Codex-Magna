# What is a mass coordination problem?
## Evergreen Description
A mass coordination problem is when a problem's tractability is a product of coordinating the parties needed in order to solve the core issue that joint parties need to solve. As the scale of a given problem grows and the parties are increasingly abstracted or insulated from the problem's effects, it becomes increasingly difficult to coordinate a sufficient number of parties to work on the problem to any measurable effect.

Examples of particularly intractable mass coordination problems are issues with climate change, wealth inequality, and/or market incentive misallignments. Depending on the mode and level of abstraction of parties connected to the whole, MCPs are particularly difficult to solve as those who have the most outsized effect on the system become increasingly isolated from their own effects.

### Questions that arise
- Is it possible that parties whose influence expands to sufficient enough a level become their own ecosystems that the effects of inflows necessary to sustain them on other systems remain sustainable enough for core motivators to be abstracted from their effects, leading to systemic parasitism? #question 
	- How would one solve for this question? How does one model a cancer?
