# What is learning from incidents?
## Evergreen Description
All rules tend to fall away in the case that failure takes over a system - not because there are necessarily issues within the software or process themselves, but usually (and almost entirely) because of human factors. 

The study of this phenomenon has lead to an expansion of the field of "Learning from Incidents" - study that concludes that a lack of coordination is where a failure insight usually emerges from - a lack of coordination over problem solving often causes the failure in the first place.

## Notes
- It can be hard to convince people of the importance of system safety - sometimes issues would be identified and nothing would happen as a result.
- Intentional delay at Netflix could be executed on live populations to see what happened. Most software failures come from short delays, nothing more, and planning for these reveals where the weaknesses are.
