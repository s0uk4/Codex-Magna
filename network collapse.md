# What is Network Collapse?
## Evergreen Description
The robusticity of a network is a function of the number of internal self-preserving cycles that exist within it. According to navigations of [[Katz Centrality]] and the Jain-Krishna model of networks, if there is high internal network diversity, it is implied that the likelihood of collapse is low due to the number of cycles existing within the diversity of interal connections for the system.

A core indicator of a collapsing system is the absence all of internal self-feeding cycles but one. That is - if the system becomes fully linear and energy is not redistributed through cycles within the system, energy accrues at one end of the system and other cycles connected to it die out.

### Barb√°si
Proposed that in [[scale free]] systems relisience is only found in the preservation of the most connected nodes - in that networks are dependent on their best connected members, while the pruning of the least connected members does not have a measurable impact on network performance.

The reason for this is that the removal of the most connected members of a network results in connection 'islands' wherein some members are isolated from all other connection, therefore unable to distribute any of their communication through the otherwise highly connected nodes.
