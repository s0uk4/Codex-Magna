# What is marginalization?
## Description
Marginalization is a word used to describe those who are at the fringes of advantaged communities - i.e. a marginalized person is an individual who does not fit into what a particular community is biased in functioning for. Marginalization is with respect to those who do not benefit from how a system is designed, because in particular, that system is not designed with them in mind.

## Notes
- thinking about it like a bell curve helps - most situations are set for those who are a part of the biggest portion of the curve, and not for those who are at the edges.
- Systems that work to try and cover the largest portion of the curve are the most '[[public good]]'.
