# What is Kolmogorov Complexity?
## Evergreen Description
Kolmogorov complexity is the most reduced something can be such that the systems that make it up can't be deduced from pure examination. Such systems frequently have qualities of [[emergence]] due to the fact that they are qualitatively distinct from that which makes them up.

Good examples of this would be ant colonies - it is difficult to break all the pieces of an ant colony down into pieces that make sense of the whole. An ant does not reflect the structure of the colony - as such the colony itself has high Kolmogorov complexity, since its pieces don't obviously make up the whole. Subsystems within a complex system could be described as being [[Markov Blanket]] layers for the systems that exist below them.
