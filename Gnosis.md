# What is Gnosis?
## Evergreen Description
Gnosis is a proposed fast finality chain that would allow [[Ethereum]] developers to work within a local economy to experiment with their implementations before seeking to port them to the Ethereum mainnet. Gnosis intends to merge with xDai as a chain and in so doing would position themselves as the [[canary network]] for the Ethereum beacon chain.
