# Organizational Threshold
Institutions are what happens when constructions of operation become idology rather than experimentation or solution-seeking. 

High complexity systems require more internal maintenance and more resources to sustain themselves over low-complexity systems, and the gradient between the two differentiates their ability to grow steadily until they are dominant versus quickly so that they are widespread. **A smaller but more connectively dense system will always outpace a larger, more loosely connected system, because a connectively dense system has the ability to adapt against its resource constraints, while the larger complex system must sustain more of its parts.**

In the establishment of a new system, the pieces of the old system that are no longer relevant will be winnowed away, leading to renewed stability of growth.

- [[complexity]] as a core concept
- [[dogma]] to [[culture]]
## Wider context
Diamandis and his work in buying the Iridium cluster is a perfect example of understanding that the best way to build something good is to build it small. Organizational load is when a system ends up spending a lot more energy maintaining itself than it takes for the system to grow, and usually comes about in late-stage systems that have outlived their utility.
Most important from this concept is understanding that the systems that seek to uphold themselves have become institutional - when a structure desires to self-preserve, it is an institution, because an [[institution]] can only offer more of itself. The threshold for a larger sstems meets to the subsystem hierarchy as a state of maintenance rather than a state of interaction - if you are able to offer more autonomy to all the pieces of a system, you allow them a way to more equally distribute the energy that each needs to contribute to the larger system and dispense with the costly approach of having to charter control of the subsystems to the control of the larger system, thereby simplifying to operation of the larger system by wrapping the smaller system in a [[Markov Blanket]]
## Density
Under organizational load, the most successful structures are those that are nimble in their adaptation but dense enough in their structure that they can be seen as indispensible. This is a function of their energetic density - the sum of potential connections $n$ against the number of outcomes that are favorable $k$, leading to $\frac{k}{n}$ adaptive outcomes for any particular event. 

A system that is not energetically dense because it has too many internal connections does not meet this value - most of the connectivity for the pieces of the system is focused instead on internal connectivity and the resource of adaptability ends up focused instead on internal management, leading to a looser and less dense organizational structure.
## In business
Organizational load takes the form of institutional structures that seek to maintain their use of resources, and so seek means through which to do so - whether by taking control of the system or by more surreptitiously taking ownership of all resources necessary to gain dominance. In a business environment, large institutions are those that have grown to a state of internal system hierarchy providing them with internal stability. An institution that is badly optimized will seek to preserve itself from a central source, a central node of control that will eventually exhaust itself with the effort - this is noo less true with a company - where the organizational load of the larger system takes on orgders of complexity that trequire the larger system to slow down in accordance with the decisionmaking paradigms.

## In science
In science, we can find ourselves looking backward to most of the most eminent thinkers in the philosophy of science - [[Kuhn]] chief among them - who say that the most important science is always rejected as it becomes the new paradigm. Part of this is the normal proceeding of science - that science must verify the ideals that are seen as novel in order to accept them into the ooverarching context of 'scientific thinking - but the reality for the specificas of the situation is that the most paradigmatically revolutionary of concepts will always be inidtially rejected.

The reason for this is plain - prvious teleological institutions seek to preserve themsevles, and none is more ossifying than the 'scientific pursuit of knowledge' in which one person's creation must be accepted as the 'correct' approach in teh ework that they are doing, at the expense of all others who might enter the discipline.

It leads to a sense of unhealthy competition to see these systems draw themselves to a standstill, and it's very much a perpetuation of the same intersystemic laws that occur throughout all of the naturall world; dominant paradigms create ideology, ideology creates dogma, dogma creates culture, culture creates institutions.

## The transitional state between dogma and culture
Understanding the threshold state between dogma to culture is understannding that culture is institution writ large - it comes iwth norms and comes with resource allocation for its own maintenance. Any sufficiently complex structure must have it's own 'culture' in order to build itself further - otherwise there is no unifying constant to bind all internal elements.

Dogma is the established set of structures that uphold internal processes - dogma provide groundwork for the rest of the system to grow - and if it grows to a sufficient level, the accepted dogma become cultural. If this culture is adapted and ossified into practices, it becomes an institution that seeks to preserve itself.

Culture does not necessarily seek to preserve itself, it is preserved because it is the [[emergence]] of new phenomenae that result from a network of connections between information.
