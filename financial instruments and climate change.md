# Can financial instruments save the world?
## Evergreen Description
Humanity's greatest achievement could be learning how to live in balance with the needs of our mother - it just needs to be profitable before anyone will do it.

The greatest issue we are going to run into as a barrier to execution is incentivizing these markets over *any other* and unfortunately present decentralized markets are interested in speculative synthetics based purely off of financial applications.

Meaning - I don't think that blockchain-based financial applications will position themselves to incurr substantive change because they depend on an external commodity. The internal (speculative) commodities market of crypto makes it so that synthetic scarcity can take a higher degree of importance than material assets.

## Notes
### ab initio
- questions to ask?
	- humans are only goaded by resources, because we are, in the end, motivated by our needs
		- "needs" are contextual - when our needs moved out of step with the needs of the networks to which we were attached, our incentives changed
		- network propogation vs [[network profligacy]] and extant growth - when does a sub-network become it's own network, not dependent on the whole?
			- at what point does a subnetwork prioritize its own growth over the use of the resources that it depends on? #question 
			- is this really and truly why we need to leave earth, because we will never not know how to consume more than we need, and will never actually be sustainable? #question
				- e.g. elon musk - he is actually pursuing the wrong logic. We should be aiming not to continue consuming all that is abundant in the universe at the cost of everything else, and instead be aiming to 
	- Can we truly create the market incentives necessary to make it profitable for us to save this planet, and is this the only way that we will be able to do so?

- [[blockchain]]s are ideal to track the use and sale of carbon credits. because current markets deal with issues of double-counting and liquidity problems, blockchains can prevent these actions as a result of how difficult it would be to dominate and control the system
