# What is Axelar?
## In a single sentence:
Axelar is a [[Cosmos]] interoperability protocol that aims to solve the protocol bridging problem by being an arbitrary bridge. In general, bridges are a centralizing force because they lock up tokens on one side of the bridge, wrapping the token on the other side. Axelar allows you to wrap the tokens not on the protocol itself but on the contract side.

## Notes

- interop is the future - lots of layers and a lot to unpack
	- two approaches - they assume a lot of technical requirements from those who they want to be a part of
	- bridges as well, but that's a sort of centralized approach - bridges
		- bridged assets are a single point of failure
- no restriction on the chains that Axelar wants to be a part of
	- easily plug in new chains, easily connect them through the interop
	- you have an asset you want to connect to, you want to make it as easy as possible.
	- applications should be able to connect seamlessly between protocols - axelar is an overlay network that allows you to connecty between ecosystems
	- build on any blockchain and then interact with Axelar gateways for interacting with other ecosystems
		- there are different actors - there is the running of the network by vallidators, there are developers who can enrich the interop functions - ways to connect modules to connect networks (incentives)
		- application developers on a particular protocol to execute calls from other ecosystems - token transfers can take a token, wrap another token, move it to another ecosystem
		- e.g. take ATOM, stake it in Compound without a bridge, you'd need applications who would port that through
		- the long game is that the idea of 'transferring assets' will go away.
			- assuming that you trust the issuer of the application and the decentralization of the 
			- read/write/logic - developers should be able to create their own logic and then have all the read/write, deploy the application-layer protocols.
	- Tokenomics governance token - users take the stake, the validators participate in consensus, rewards passed back to delegators
		- validators earn rewards - inflationary rewards.
			- number of tokens delegated to validators
			- inflation rate is not set yet.
			- governance is going to the same as it would be for other cosmos chains.
		- validators also participate in governance and register to vote on events on that connection, you earn rewards for voting on that event - confirmation of the transaction on the source chain to confirm the tx on the destination chain.
		- validators can choose which chains that you want to participate
- are we running on Axelar? not sure.
