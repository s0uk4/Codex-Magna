Ixo is a [[Cosmos]] protocol that seeks to create an 'internet of impact' in which the verified metrics of impact for different social economics development projects are measured and there is price discovery based on the success of funded projects. They have deployed a number of projects that show in test phases that their can participate in Proof of Impact, and in so doing are aiming to create a market for impact verification using Impact Tokens.

## Additional notes:
Community currencies - 
	this market allows you to create hyperlocal currencies that local communities can then roll out of when they have executed successfully on a given project. What this essentially looks like is that if a project that someone is a part of is successful, the tokens then have value. In this way, there is a verification component and a prediction component.
Verification strategies for Impact tokens
	- essentially: *How can you measure the success of a project in a way that helps the community that executes it directly rather than trying to do so peacemeal through grants. This creates an economy around execution.*
	- people can take out claims of impact/execution on more or less anything
	- IXO Hong Kong is doing a project around social innovation projects
		- [GreenYoma](https://www.yoma.foundation/about)
	- **more data on execution of impact means you create a probability measurement tool for executable projects**
	- claims of outcomes on verified outcomes
Tokenomic games around verification of [[Proof of Impact]]
	- whitelabel projects around a data consortium of impact
	-**ixo is an impact verification tool in a market that is building requirements for measuring impact**
	- Need to know more about local economies and these Alphabonds work
Alphabonds
	- **takes the form of an NFT that can be fractionalized into fiat-convertable tokens.**
	- automated mechanism for issuing and managing treasury allocation which can be configured to direct outcome payments into a community currency reserveincentivizes reaching achievement goals for the execution of shared ogals (s/a immunization goals)
	- currency supply expands as a result in response to actual economic growth that is non-inflationary.
	- value of the community currency token
	- moves against the 'blunt instrument' approach of stimulus payments
What is the broader roadmap?
	- Currently experimenting in Myanmar, working with Unicef, and in Hong Kong
	- all projects that are looking at measuring impact on a quantifiable basis, by using KPIs that track them
	- Eventual goal is to be utilized for all kinda of certification requirements to show proof of execution - whether for NGOs or corps
