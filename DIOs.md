# What is a Decentralized Impact Organization?
## Evergreen Description
DIOs are deployable organizations that mobilizes around the need for an adaptive, collaborative approach to solutioning toward social impacts. They are an evolution of 1980s thinking on how to financialize social impact in the form of Social Policy Bonds or Social Impact Bonds by deploying action with interest parties who would mint tokens based on vetted data feeds.

## Notes
In order to get to net-zero, we need to draw carbon from the atmosphere - full transformation of the economy.
- all levers of change must be engaged, across all dimension - but how do we actually get this to happen?
- there are too many parts to the system itself, because it's a [[complex adaptive system]]
- Social Policy Bonds (SPBs) are financial instruments that reward people for achieving goals (similar to [[impact tokens]])
	- these are perfect for climate goals because the outcomes are measurable and are something that we can see having a concrete impact.
		- Why would people trade them?
	- SPBs incurr a certain return when the impact goals are met, so the benefit of them is that they are provable impact that can then be traded on the market
		- theoretically this would incentivize parties to act in interest of social impact *so that others don't need to*
		- additionally the value of the bonds increases as a result of processes being efficient in their course toward success
- Social Impact Bonds (SIBs)
	- not tradeable
- SPBs have not met their requirements because they don't reach goals in the timescales necessary for execution, so they remain more speculative than useful.
	- DAOs could fix this
		- creating frictionless markets for tokenized impact bonds
